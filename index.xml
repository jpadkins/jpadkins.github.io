      <description>Introduction Here I describe a style I like to adhere to when writing C. It borrows a lot from existing styles like Kernel and GNU and tries to incorporate rules from both with an emphasis on readability. Along with syntax guidelines, I also describe a structure for ordering and labelling the contents of source and header files. For anything that I don&amp;rsquo;t specifically cover here, I generally use the Kernel style conventions.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a programming enthusiast from the DFW area. I generally go by jpadkins or jacobpadkins online. If you see someone with that name, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance it&amp;rsquo;s me.
I&amp;rsquo;ve got a thing for webdev, Ruby, C, CRPGS, Roguelikes, cult/exploitation/B films, old pulp sci-fi and fantasy novels, comparative mythology, and IRL exploration, so that&amp;rsquo;s what you can expect me to write about. Mostly.
Q &amp;amp; A Q: Why does your website look like it was designed by someone in the 90s?</description>
